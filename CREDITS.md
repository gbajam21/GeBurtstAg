## Math and Algorithms
### Triangle rasterisation code by Mats Byggmastar (a.k.a. MRI/Doomsday): *Fast affine texture mapping/fatmap.txt*
(In *source/render/rasteriser.h*)

It is to be noted that my modifications might have introduced erros etc. which are not present in the original version. Please refer to the original.

### Fast signed and unsigned division *(gba-modern)*
(In *asm/sdiv32.s* and *asm/udiv32.s*)

(Where udiv32.s is apparently taken from <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~theom/riscos/docs/ultimate/a252div.txt> (last retrieved 2021-07-09) according to the author.)

### Line-line intersections
(In *source/render/clipping.c*)

(Modified to avoid division by zero).

### *Smoothstep* lerp (*Interpolation tricks* by Jari Komppa)
Implemented (and modified etc.) in *source/math.c*

## Debugging/Misc
### *mgba_printf* by Nick Sells/adverseengineer
(In *source/logutils.c*)

### *REG_WAITCNT* settings 
```REG_WAITCNT = 0x4317```yields big performance improvements over the defaults in my case. (That register controls the pre-fetch buffer and the waitstates of the external cartridge bus etc.)

Thanks to the [gbadev](https://discord.io/gbadev) users who made me aware of this.

### Credits Theme
(In *assets/music/BuxWV250.mod*)

The "credits theme" is based on melodies from the *Aria in G major "La capricciosa" (BuxWV250)* by Dieterich Buxtehude (1637/39 – 1707). 


## 3d Models
### A molecule

(In *assets/models/cpa.obj*)

Credits for this model go to "Jmol development team". (Molecule generated/exported from jsmol: <http://jmol.sourceforge.net>.)

(I used Blender's decimate modifier to reduce its polygon count.)  
### *Suzanne*
(In *assets/models/suzanne.obj*)

A default model in Blender 2.8. which belongs to its respective author. Only used for debugging/profiling. 

(I used Blender's decimate modifier to reduce its polygon count.)

## Toolchain/Tools
### *devkitARM* by devkitPro
Indispensable for building/cross-compiling. The *libtonc* which comes with devkitARM is required for using this project (as I don't bundle it).

The top level *Makefile* of this project is based on their template: <https://github.com/devkitPro/gba-examples/blob/master/template/Makefile> (last retrieved 2021-07-09)

cf. <https://devkitpro.org> (last retrieved 2021-07-09)

### *mGBA*
Indsipensable for debugging and emulation. I used version 0.9.1 on macos "Big Sur" for this project (mostly with interframe blending and bilinear filtering enabled).
